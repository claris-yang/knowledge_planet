They’re not OS threads, and they’re not exactly green
threads—threads that are managed by a language’s runtime—they’re a higher level of
abstraction known as coroutines. Coroutines are simply concurrent subroutines
(functions, closures, or methods in Go) that are nonpreemptive—that is, they cannot
be interrupted. Instead, coroutines have multiple points throughout which allow for
suspension or reentry.

goroutines managed by go runtime. go runtime observes the runtime behavior of
goroutines and automatically suspends them when they block and then resumes them when they 
become unblocked.
